# ReactionalReactPortfolio
## Description

AS a web development student, I wanted to present my experience by building a single-page application so that my potential employees can see my Deployed React Portfolio of work samples! 

## App Deployment Link

https://hsreactportfolio.netlify.app/


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer:

WHEN I load the portfolio, THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.

WHEN I view the header, THEN I see the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.

WHEN I view the navigation titles, THEN I see titles for "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume," with the title for the current section highlighted.

WHEN I click on a navigation title, THEN the corresponding section is displayed without the page reloading, and that title is highlighted.

WHEN I load the portfolio for the first time, THEN the "About Me" title and section are selected by default.

WHEN I view the "About Me" section, THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio.

WHEN I view the "Portfolio" section, THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications, with links to both the deployed applications and their corresponding GitHub repositories.

WHEN I view the "Contact" section, THEN I see a contact form with fields for name, email address, and message.

WHEN I move my cursor out of a form field without entering text, THEN I receive a notification that this field is required.

WHEN I enter text in the email address field, THEN I receive a notification if the email address is invalid.

WHEN I view the "Resume" section, THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.

WHEN I view the footer, THEN I see links to the developer’s GitHub, LinkedIn profiles, and a third platform (Stack Overflow or Twitter).
